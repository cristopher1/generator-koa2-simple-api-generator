**Create the Docker container**

```sh
docker run --env-file .env -p HOST_PORT:PORT THE_TAG_USED_IN_DOCKER_BUILD
```

For more information, use:

```sh
docker run --help
```

Where HOST_PORT is the port in the host used to access to API and PORT is a environment variable that is in .env file

**The API documentation is in http://localhost:HOST_PORT/api/v1/docs**

### <a id="docker-compose-support"></a> Run the API using docker-compose.yml created by generator-koa2-api-generator

#### Prerequisites
