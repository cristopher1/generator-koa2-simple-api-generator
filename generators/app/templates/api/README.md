### [Index](#index)

- [Run the API in localhost](#localhost)
- [Run the API using DockerFile created by generator-koa2-simple-api-generator](#docker-support)
- [Run the API using docker-compose.yml created by generator-koa2-simple-api-generator](#docker-compose-support)

Routes used by the API generated by generator-koa2-simple-api-generator:

- POST api/v1/users/register/

### <a id="docker-support"></a> Run the API using Dockerfile created by generator-koa2-simple-api-generator

#### Prerequisites

- You must have Docker installed
- <a ref="https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/">You must have Docker BuildKit</a>
- The database you are going to use must be installed, configured and running

**Enter the api folder**

```sh

```

**Environment variables**

Configure the environment variables into .env file

**Create the Docker image**

```sh

```

Replace SOME_TAG by some name to identify the image, example: my_api:1.0.0 or my_api

--target: Used when the Dockerfile contains AS (target), for example: AS base, AS development, AS production, etc
The Dockerfile generated by generator-koa2-simple-api-generator contains two target: base and development

For more information, use:

```sh
docker buildx build --help
```

**Create the Docker container**

```sh
docker run --env-file .env -p HOST_PORT:PORT THE_TAG_USED_IN_DOCKER_BUILD
```

For more information, use:

```sh
docker run --help
```

Where HOST_PORT is the port in the host used to access to API and PORT is a environment variable that is in .env file

**access the api from the url http://localhost:HOST_PORT/api/v1/, using postman or another tool**

### <a id="docker-compose-support"></a> Run the API using docker-compose.yml created by generator-koa2-simple-api-generator

#### Prerequisites

- You must have Docker and Docker Compose installed
- <a ref="https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/">You must have Docker BuildKit</a>

**In the folder that contains the docker-compose.yml file.Run the following command**
